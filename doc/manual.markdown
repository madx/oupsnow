# Several roles

## Global Admin

A global admin is like big brother. He can access to Oupsnow's administration
panel. He also has all the rights of a Project admin.

## Project admin

A project admin is a user with admin powers on a particular project. He can view
and change the settings of the project. He also has all the rights of a basic
user.

## User

An user can only browse projects, create tickets or update them.

## Anonymous

An anonymous user is an unregistered user. He can see all information about
projects and tickets but can't update them.

# Project settings

## Delete project

Since Oupsnow-0.4.0, you can delete a project. If you delete a project all
information about this project is deleted too.
Project information include:

* Tickets
* Ticket updates
* Members
* Events (timeline)
* Milestones

There is no way to revert the deletion of a project.

Only a global admin can delete projects, simple users or project admins can't.
